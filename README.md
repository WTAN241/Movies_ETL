# Movies_ETL
## Purpose of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. Data is taken from three files: Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data. Then the ETL process is performed and the data is added to a PostgraSQL database.
